## Election-Audit Summary

In summary, same script can be used for any election data in any state with simple modifications like below

* You can modify the script to determine list of political parties that received votes, number of votes and voting percentage for each party by using conditionals and loops like the way we did for getting county voting info. Also, calculate the winning party based on highest votes turnout. Print the output to the terminal as well as save it to the text file ie we did in this challenge.

* We can filter the data further and determine which political party won in each state and how many states are won by each political party and the final winning party in the country based on highest number of states won. Print the output to the terminal as well as save it to the text file ie we did in this challenge.
